# Twitch View Tracker

Real-time Twitch viewer count for the top 10 most popular streaming games. More features planned for the future!

Notes:

Mouse-over a line to bring up information about the corresponding game.
Current mouse-over information (will add more soon): 
- game name
- viewer count

### Required Libraries:

- json - Twitch response data format
- matplotlib - Plotting and animating
- numpy - Used in animation for graph updating

### Known Issues:
- When a new game enters top 10 list, mouse-over tooltip reports operand type errors (can be ignored).
- Lack of comments, will fix shortly!
